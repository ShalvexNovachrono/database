# Datebase: A Google Authenticator Clone
Description

Datebase is a PHP-based authentication system that provides a user-friendly way to manage user logins and registrations. It offers seamless integration with existing login and registration pages, enabling you to leverage its robust authentication features without modifying your existing codebase.

This project uses a Sqlite file and [ReplitDB](https://github.com/ShalvexNovachrono/PHP-Replit-Database-Example-Template) to store data.
Make sure you add proper encryption, when I tried to add it, it worked on my local computer but not on Replit.
